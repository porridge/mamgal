List of things to do
--------------------

The following things would be useful, though not critical:


Add options for forcing mmgal to refresh slides and/or miniatures despite them
being fresh. This will be useful when e.g. regenerating the gallery in a
different locale (or with some modified options, when they are implemented).

There are some features in imageindex which would be nice to have, such as
graphic smileys, or greater ability to control the appearance of pages.
