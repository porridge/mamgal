List of things to do
--------------------

The following things would be useful, though not critical:


Add options for forcing mamgal to refresh slides and/or miniatures despite them
being fresh. This will be useful when e.g. regenerating the gallery in a
different locale (or with some modified options, when they are implemented).

There are some features in imageindex which would be nice to have, such as
graphic smileys, or greater ability to control the appearance of pages.

Ability to rapidly move from a directory to any of its parents by clicking on a
component of the path displayed at the top of the page.

Parallel processing - having all CPUs busy generating the gallery would be
nice, but need to think AT LEAST of the following possibly non-thread-safe
calls first:
 - fork (to call mplayer): possibly fork off a worker process before starting any threads
 - localtime/gmtime: :-/
 - readdir: only ever call from the main thread?
 - thread-safety of other modules that we use
