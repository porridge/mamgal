List of known bugs
==================

1. Broken links to deleted image slide.

   Description: When you delete an image, and re-run mamgal, it will delete the
   image and all its associated files (slide, miniatures, etc), as well as
   update the index, but will not fix the links to that image from previous and
   following images. 

   Workaround: just "touch(1)" the previous and following image, and re-run mamgal.

   Fix: in order not to force re-writing all slides at all times, will probably
   need to store some metadata about what images were present during last run.

2. No i18n for error messages.

   Fix: mark messages for xgettext and call gettext in Logger.
