mmgal - a program for creating static image galleries
Copyright 2007-2009 Marcin Owsiany <marcin@owsiany.pl>

Supported backend image information libraries
=============================================

The program works with either Image::ExifTool or Image::Info. However
Image::ExifTool is recommended, and Image::Info is only supported on a
"best-effort" basis. (In fact the Image::Info documentation states that
Image::ExifTool is a better and less buggy library.)

Performance comparison with imageindex:
=======================================

Gallery: 15GB of 9100 images in 528 folders
