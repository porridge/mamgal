mamgal - a program for creating static image galleries
Copyright 2007-2010 Marcin Owsiany <marcin@owsiany.pl>

Features:
=========

MaMGal was inspired by imageindex(1) and as such aims for a similar featureset
but higher efficiency as well as better code architecture and test coverage.

*   Index and slide views, simple layouts.

*   Image captions extracted from comments embedded in images themselves. This
    way your photo descriptions will never get lost.

*   Static HTML output, no need for PHP or other server-side execution support.

*   Designed with efficiency in mind - only reads and processes the files which
    were modified since the last run.

*   Image creation time extracted from EXIF metadata.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
=============

MaMGal needs a backend image information library. It works with either
Image::ExifTool or Image::Info. However Image::ExifTool is recommended, and
Image::Info is only supported on a "best-effort" basis. (In fact its own
documentation states that Image::ExifTool is a more featureful and less buggy
library.)

Other dependencies are documented in Makefile.PL

mplayer is useful, but not strictly necessary for galleries which contain films.

Installation:
=============

Please follow instructions in perlmodinstall. Afterwards, if your language is
listed in LINGUAS in po/Makefile you may want to run the following command to
install translation catalogs:

  make -C po install

Release notes:
==============

1.4: Fixed unit tests tests under Perl 5.10

 - Exporter had been used incorrectly in App::MaMGal::TestHelper

1.3: Improved performance:

 - creates just one stylesheet file, in the root directory, and deletes legacy
   stylesheet files in other directories.
   NOTE: This will cause the first run to be somewhat longer, as all HTML files
   need to be regenerated to point to the single stylesheet file.

 - does not regenerate the montage file if it is fresh (i.e. more recent than
   the directory timestamp and timestamps of its interesting elements)

 - does not regenerate the index file if it is fresh (i.e. more recent than the
   directory timestamp and timestamps of all its elements)

1.2: First public release, using the App::MaMGal namespace
